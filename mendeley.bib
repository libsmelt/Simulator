- Use of manifests
- code as CPU independet instruction set
- translated to machine code on launch
- Kernel and UL programs written in Sing\#, which is a C\# variant
- microkernel
- channel endpoints are capabilities
- AS partitioned in kernel, one region for every SIP and exchange heap
- SIP has only pointer to own memory or memory in exchange heap belonging owned by it
- Pointers in exchange heap only point to other regions in the exchange heap

There is additional overhead (Figure 5) for the Nexus runtime. It is never faster than the native MPL. Why would anyone use this? Same for Figure 8. Nexus introduces additional overhead, but cannot show any benefit from the newly added flexibility.},

@article{Dean2008,
abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large datasets that is amenable to a broad variety of real-world tasks. Users specify the computation in terms of a map and a reduce function, and the underlying runtime system automatically parallelizes the computation across large-scale clusters of machines, handles machine failures, and schedules inter-machine communication to make efficient use of the network and disks. Programmers find the system easy to use: more than ten thousand distinct MapReduce programs have been implemented internally at Google over the past four years, and an average of one hundred thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day, processing a total of more than twenty petabytes of data per day.},

@techreport{UCAM-CL-TR-319,
abstract = {The advent of high speed networks in the wide and local
area enables multimedia traffic to be easily carried
between workstation class machines. The dissertation
considers an architecture for a workstation to support
such traffic effectively. In addition to presenting the
information to a human user the architecture allows
processing to be done on continuous media streams.

The proposed workstation architecture, known as the Desk
Area Network (DAN), extends ideas from Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM) networks into the end-system. All
processors and devices are connected to an ATM
interconnect. The architecture is shown to be capable of
supporting both multimedia data streams and more
traditional CPU cache line traffic. The advocated
extension of the CPU cache which allows caching of
multimedia data streams is shown to provide a natural
programming abstraction and a mechanism for synchronising
the processor with the stream.

A prototype DAN workstation has been built. Experiments
have been done to demonstrate the features of the
architecture. In particular the use of the DAN as a
processor-to-memory interconnect is closely studied to
show the practicality of using ATM for cache line traffic
in a real machine. Simple demonstrations of the stream
cache ideas are used to show its utility in future
applications.},

abstract = {Different kinds of people use computers now than several decades ago, but operating systems have not fully kept pace with this change. It is true that we have point-and-click GUIs now instead of command line interfaces, but the expectation of the average user is different from what it used to be, because the user is different. Thirty or 40 years ago, when operating systems began to solidify into their current form, almost all computer users were programmers, scientists, engineers, or similar professionals doing heavy-duty computation, and they cared a great deal about speed. Few teenagers and even fewer grandmothers spent hours a day behind their terminal. Early users expected the computer to crash often; reboots came as naturally as waiting for the neighborhood TV repairman to come replace the picture tube on their home TVs. All that has changed and operating systems need to change with the times.},

implements both: message-passing and CC shared-memory

        
CC shared memory is a layer between the core and the network. it abstracts away the network.

        
Alewife allows breaking this layer and accessing the network for direct message passing. 

        
CC is implemented using a directory

        
Alewife calls the mcp a network coprocessor. Writing a message only takes a few cycles, receiving traps (only 5 cycles overhead?)},
