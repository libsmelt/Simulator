@comment{{Suggested rules for editing the bib file, so we all stay sane and
have pretty bibliographies in our papers:

  0. for any new entries, construct the key as either:
     <name of system>:<venue>
     or:
     <first author's surname>:<venue>
     or:
     <first author's surname>:<most significant word from title>:<venue>
  1. keep entries in alphabetical order, sorted by key
  2. for any venue from which we have more than one entry, define a string
     for the booktitle or journal, and place it in the accompanying defs.bib
  3. use the location field rather than the address for conferences
  4. for the month field, use the unquoted strings jan/feb/mar/etc.
     -- this allows abbreviating bib styles to easily abbreviate them
  5. if importing bib entries from IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, DBLP, Citeseer etc.
     PLEASE clean them up to match these guidelines, in particular:
      * remove the publisher field unless it really isn't obvious
      * remove the useless New York address that ACM DL always puts on bib entries
      * check for and {Protect} any words in the title that should be
        capitalised

Note that this file will not compile without defs.bib; ie. you need to do:
  \bibliography{defs,thisfile}
